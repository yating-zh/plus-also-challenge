# Plus Also AI Challenge

### 1. Introduction

- This is an MVP of an AI image enhancer application, allowing users to upload an image and edit it by adding prompts. 

- The tech stack is MERN. As I only started self-teaching MERN two weeks ago, this challenge helped me realise there is still a lot to learn.

- I acknowledge that I used AI tools during development. Nevertheless, it works, and I learned a great deal through this project.

- The API used is OpenAIâ€™s `gpt-image-1`: https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images/createEdit. 

### 2. Setup

- Server  
    > npm install  
    > node index.js

- Client  
    > npm run dev

- .env file  
    > OPENAI_API_KEY=

### 3. Testing and Evaluation
- Test online via https://plus-also-challenge-front-end.onrender.com/

- The password on the home page is: `goodday`

- Just follow the steps:  

        upload image -> add prompt -> select aspect ratio -> submit -> enhanced image appears -> download image

    > Sometimes it may take over 30 seconds to generate the image.

- Image generation is limited due to a low credit balance (less than $10).


### 4. Self Reflection

- Need to build a stronger foundation in CSS and continue learning React and Node.js through hands-on projects.

- Work on improving my skills in web security.
